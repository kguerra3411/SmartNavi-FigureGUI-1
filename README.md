# SmartNavi
Campus navigation system to find the most optimal path for different locations. 

Algorithm Notes:
- BFS: Generally Moderate - Chooses the path with the least amount of stops, but may not be optimal in terms of distance. (Unweighted)
- DFS: Generally Slower - Chooses the farest route but allows access to more scenery or buildings if needed by the user. (Unweighted)
- Dijkstra: Generally Faster - Chooses the most optimal route based on time or distance. (Weighted)
